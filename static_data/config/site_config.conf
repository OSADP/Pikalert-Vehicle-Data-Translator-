# Site Configuration File
#
# For each site you must include these variables to provide
# default characteristics for each site/route/location.
#
#		SITE_ID:
#               TZ_CODE:
#               NUM_LAYERS:
#               LAYER_MAT:
#               LAYER_THICKNESS:
#
# The SITE_ID is an integer code of the site. SITE_ID must be the first
# keyword in a block of keywords to denote new site information.
#
# The TZ_CODE is a variable that is used to establish the local time zone
# for the site.  The format for the TZ_CODE should follow the TZ environment
# variable format:  std offset dst offset
#   where std and dst are:
#     Three or more letters that you specify to designate the 
#     standard (std) or summer (dst) time zone. Only std is required. 
#     If you omit dst, then summer time doesn't apply in this locale.
#   where offset is:
#     The value you must add to the local time to arrive at Coordinated 
#     Universal Time (UTC). The offset has the form: hh[:mm[:ss]]
#     Minutes (mm) and seconds (ss) are optional. The hour (hh) is required; 
#     it may be a single digit. 
#  The offset following std is required. If no offset follows dst, summer time 
#  is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time.  If preceded by a "-", the 
#  time zone is east of the prime meridian; otherwise it's west (which may be 
#  indicated by an optional preceding "+").
#
#  For example, the TZ_CODE for Eastern time would be: EST5EDT
#    Eastern Standard Time is 5 hours earlier than Coordinated Universal 
#    Time (UTC). Standard time and daylight saving time both apply to this 
#    locale.  By default, daylight savings time is one hour ahead of standard 
#    time (EST5EDT4), specifying EST5EDT4 is not required.  
#
# NUM_LAYERS is the number of distinct pavement layers to model
#
# The options for LAYER_MAT are the integer codes for
# snow(1), clay(2), sand(3), loam(90), concrete(91),
# aggregate base(92), asphalt1(93), asphalt2(94).
# Note that the deepest layer is listed first.
#
# The LAYER_THICKNESS has units of meters. Note that the deepest node
# is listed first.
#
# TRAFFIC is a set of 24 integers in the range 1-3. Each of the 24 values                 
# represents the traffic volume during a particular hour of the day. The                  
# first value in the set represents local midnight and the last value 
# represents 2300. Values 1-3 map to low-high traffic volumes.  
#
# ROUTE_LENGTH is the length in miles of the plow route. (Used for
# material management purposes only.) 
#
# ROUTE_LANES is the number of traffic lanes in the plow route. (Used
# for material management purposes only.)
#
# ROUTE_TREATMENT_TIME is the length of time requried to treat the
# route. (For the E-470 sites, this time is the low end of their time
# range since they said they are always out.)
#
# TREATMENT_STRATEGY tells the system to trigger on hazardous events
# (0) or every route time (1). 0 would be a more "reactive" strategy,
# while 1 would be more aggressive.
#
# SNOW_PLOW_THRESHOLD is the minimum amount of snow (mm) for triggering
# a plow treatment.
#
# CHEM_TYPE is the chemical type number which will be used when 
# treatments are recommended. Valid values are:
#
#	0 = Not set
#	1 = NACL
#	2 = CACL2
#	3 = MGCL2
#	4 = CMA
#	5 = KAC
#	6 = Caliber
#	7 = IceSlicer
#	8 = IceBan
#
# CHEM_FORM is the form of the chemical which can be:
#
#	0 = Dry
#	1 = Prewet
#	2 = Liquid
#
# CHEM_MIN_APPLICATION_RATE is the lowest allowed application rate
# for the CHEM_TYPE. Units depend on CHEM_FORM; lbs/lane-mile
# for dry or prewet, gal/lane-mile for liquid.
#
# CHEM_MAX_APPLICATION_RATE is the highest allowed application rate
# for the CHEM_TYPE. Units depend on CHEM_FORM; lbs/lane-mile
# for dry or prewet, gal/lane-mile for liquid.
#
# CHEM_RATE_INCREMENT is the increment to use for recommended 
# treatment application rates. Same units as CHEM_MIN_APPLICATION_RATE
# and CHEM_MAX_APPLICATION_RATE.
#
# PRETREAT_TYPE is the chemical type number which will be used when 
# pre-treatments are recommended. (See CHEM_TYPE)
#
# PRETREAT_FORM is the form of the pretreat chemical. (see CHEM_FORM)
#
# PRETREAT_MIN_APPLICATION_RATE is the lowest allowed application rate
# for the PRETREAT_TYPE. Units depend on PRETREAT_FORM; lbs/lane-mile
# for dry or prewet, gal/lane-mile for liquid.
#
# PRETREAT_MAX_APPLICATION_RATE is the highest allowed application rate
# for the PRETREAT_TYPE. Units depend on PRETREAT_FORM; lbs/lane-mile
# for dry or prewet, gal/lane-mile for liquid
#
# PRETREAT_RATE_INCREMENT is the increment to use for recommended pre- 
# treatment application rates. Same units as PRETREAT_MIN_APPLICATION_RATE
# and PRETREAT_MAX_APPLICATION_RATE.
