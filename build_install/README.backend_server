The backend server consists of a number of Python wsgi modules and
Python scripts that support the EMDSS and MAW web displays as well as
the MAW phone application.

The backend server requires the Apache Tomcat server
(http://tomcat.apache.org/) and the modwsgi module
(http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HelpOnInstalling/ApacheWithModWSGI,
https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/)

See INSTALL.backend_server for installation information.
