####Release Notes

Over the last few years, the United States Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) have joined forces to promote safety, mobility, and the environment on the nation's surface transportation system through a new Connected Vehicle initiative. This initiative aims to enable wireless communications among vehicles, the infrastructure, and passengers' personal communication devices. The long-term goal for connected vehicles includes the collection of vehicular and environmental status data by millions of passenger and commercial vehicles.

The utility of mobile vehicle data are especially valued for diagnosing road weather conditions. On average, 24% of all crashes occur in adverse weather, leading to nearly 7,000 deaths and almost 600,000 injuries in the USA in a given year. Some vehicle measurements, such as ambient air temperature and atmospheric pressure, have direct relevance for understanding weather conditions and have a direct effect on the roadway surface conditions during the winter months. Additionally, other vehicle observations, including windshield wiper status, antilock braking system (ABS) status, and traction control status, are indirectly informative of local road weather conditions.

Working with the FHWA and RITA, NCAR is developing the PikalertÂ® System to ingest and quality-check these vehicle observations, and then combine the vehicle data with more traditional weather data (e.g., radar, satellite) to develop road condition and road hazard information. Recent analysis focused on two key areas: creating the Pikalert Enhanced Maintenance and Decision Support System (EMDSS), which incorporates Connected Vehicle technology into the MDSS, and developing the Pikalert Motorist Advisory and Warning (MAW) System, which provides hyper-local and rapid-update road weather warnings to the travelling public. These two applications were developed in FY13/14 with data from Minnesota, Michigan, and Nevada DOTs.

The EMDSS represents the latest innovation in snow control. Building on years of MDSS development, the EMDSS incorporates Connected Vehicle data into the forecast and decision process. As a result, end users can obtain information along the entire stretch of roadway, and not just at Road Weather Information System (RWIS) sites. This enables maintenance providers to better monitor and react to changing road conditions. They will be better equipped to make spot treatments on the road, improving safety, mobility, and reducing the environmental impact of de-icing chemical. The MAW is a revolutionary approach to providing hyper-local, near real-time road weather information for the travelling public. Incorporating Connected Vehicle data, the MAW provides current inferences for visibility, road condition, and road precipitation. It also blends the Connected Vehicle data with a forecast engine to provide 24-hour forecasts of road weather conditions. Using the MAW, drivers will be able to plan routes in advance of their travel, including knowing which way to go and whether to delay travel. While on the road, a phone application keeps drivers abreast of changing road weather conditions.
